This repository makes use of Architectural Design Records (ADR), which should be added as ordered subpages to this header page. 

The purpose of ADR is to keep a simple, lightweight and clear timeline of architectural decisions on a project, that helps to understand why certain decisions were made. Having a history also prevents repeating past mistakes, and understand why certain choices may have changed over time. 

- For subpages, please use the formatting #### - _ADR title_ , with #### being a zero-padded increment starting from 0001. 
- 0000 is reserved for the ADR template.
